      <p>
       I grew up in Beaver Dam Wisconsin and moved to Madison Wisconsin for high school. I am a rising junior at UW Madison for Computer science. I am also a member of the Air National Guard and have been enlisted for over 4 years now and have gone on one deployment to Saudi Arabia.

        In my free time I like to work on varioius coding projects, running, and playing video games. I also have a cute kitty named boots who helps keep me company when i'm coding.
