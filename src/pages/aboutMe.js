      <p>
        I grew up in Beaver Dam Wisconsin and moved to Madison Wisconsin for
        high school. I am a rising junior at UW Madison for Computer science. I
        am also a member of the Air National Guard and have been enlisted for
        over 4 years now and have gone on one deployment to Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I like to work on varioius coding projects, running, and
        playing video games. I also have a cute kitty named boots who helps keep
        me company when i'm coding.
